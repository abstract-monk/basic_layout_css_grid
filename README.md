# Basic CSS/HTML Layout Using Grid

This is a basic single page table style layout using css grid. 

It uses a mobile first approach where it displays each section in an a single
column as they are ordered in the html file. On larger displays it renders as
a two column layout with the sidebar to the left.

The sections are ordered as such:

Header
Sidebar
Content
Footer
